## Generated Plots

### 1. **wigner_convergence.png**
**Description:** Demonstrates how the empirical eigenvalue distribution converges to the Wigner semicircle law as matrix size increases.

**What it shows:**
- 4 subplots for matrix sizes: n = 100, 500, 1000, 5000
- Blue histogram: Empirical eigenvalue density
- Red curve: Theoretical Wigner semicircle ρ(λ) = (1/2π)√(4-λ²)
- As n increases, the match improves dramatically

**Key insight:** Even n=500 shows excellent agreement with theory. By n=5000, the match is nearly perfect.

### 2. **universality_comparison.png**
**Description:** Demonstrates universality in eigenvalue spacing statistics - GOE and GUE have different spacing distributions, both distinct from Poisson.

**What it shows:**
- Histogram overlays for GOE (blue) and GUE (green) nearest-neighbor spacings
- Theoretical curves:
  - GOE Wigner surmise: P(s) ∝ s·exp(-πs²/4) (blue line)
  - GUE Wigner surmise: P(s) ∝ s²·exp(-4s²/π) (green line)
  - Poisson (independent): P(s) = exp(-s) (red dashed)

**Key insight:** 
- **Level repulsion**: P(s→0) = 0 for GOE/GUE (eigenvalues repel!)
- Poisson has P(0) = 1 (no repulsion, levels can cluster)
- GUE has stronger repulsion than GOE (s² vs s behavior)

### 3. **marchenko_pastur_varying_gamma.png**
**Description:** Shows how the Marchenko-Pastur distribution shape changes with aspect ratio γ = p/n.

**What it shows:**
- 4 subplots for different aspect ratios: γ = 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.5
- Green histogram: Empirical eigenvalue density from Wishart matrices
- Red curve: Theoretical Marchenko-Pastur distribution
- Blue dashed lines: Support boundaries [λ₋, λ₊] where λ± = (1±√γ)²

**Key insight:**
- Small γ (0.2): Narrow distribution concentrated near 1
- Large γ (1.5): Wide distribution, more spread out
- The spike near λ=0 becomes more prominent as γ increases
- All empirical distributions match theory beautifully

---

### 4. **finite_size_convergence.png**
**Description:** Quantifies how fast the empirical distribution converges to theory as matrix size increases.

**What it shows:**
- Log-log plot of Integrated Squared Error (ISE) vs matrix size n
- Purple circles: Measured ISE for n = 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000
- Gray dashed line: Reference 1/√n convergence rate

**Key insight:**
- Error decreases as approximately n^(-0.5) (matches theoretical prediction!)
- For n ≥ 1000, ISE < 0.01 (excellent approximation)
- Practical recommendation: n ≥ 500 for most applications

---

### 5. **edge_fluctuations.png**
**Description:** Distribution of the largest eigenvalue across many random matrix realizations.

**What it shows:**
- Histogram of λ_max from 300 independent GOE matrices (n=1000)
- Red dashed line: Theoretical edge at λ = 2
- Blue solid line: Empirical mean

**Key insight:**
- Largest eigenvalue fluctuates around the edge λ = 2
- Fluctuations scale as n^(-2/3) (Tracy-Widom regime)
- Mean is slightly below 2 (finite-size effect)
- Distribution is NOT Gaussian - it's Tracy-Widom distributed!

## How to Generate More Plots

All plots can be regenerated by running the Jupyter notebooks:

```bash
jupyter notebook
# Open notebooks/01_introduction.ipynb through 05_universality.ipynb
# Run all cells to generate complete set of plots
```

Each notebook generates multiple plots saved to this directory.

## Interpreting the Plots

### What to Look For

1. **Histogram-Theory Match:** How well do blue bars align with red curves?
2. **Convergence:** Do larger n values show better agreement?
3. **Support:** Are eigenvalues within expected ranges?
4. **Level Repulsion:** Does P(s) → 0 as s → 0?
5. **Universality:** Do different ensembles/distributions give same local statistics?

### Common Observations

- **Bulk vs Edge:** Bulk density converges faster than edges
- **Finite-Size Effects:** Small matrices show visible deviations
- **Universality:** Local statistics are remarkably robust
- **Fluctuations:** Edge eigenvalues have non-Gaussian fluctuations
